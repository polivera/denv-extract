You can connect to a remote server using the --server flag and using ssh url like ```ssh://user@host```.

### How to install
Run the following command: ``` go install github.com/polivera/denv-extract@latest```

### Known issues
* If the ssh connection requires prompt (either because of first connect of because of OTP authentication) the app will hang
* I just test this 3 times so I'm sure it will be a lot more :)

### Todo
* Add tests to this
* Find more functionality to add
